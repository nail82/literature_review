Based on earlier work performed in the Eulerian paper, the authors of this paper introduce a new method to amplify small motions which has improved noise characteristics and increased amplification potential.

- Replaced Laplacians with steerable pyramids using Gabor filters
- Gabors have a complex response and phase images are used to filter the motion.
- Good experimental section. ground truthed magnification with controlled experiments.
