This paper identifies a limitation of the human visual system with regard to low sensitivity in the temporal domain.  Small motions and brightness changes go undetected.  The main idea of the paper is to explore a method for amplifying these small changes in an image sequence in order to visualize them.  The approach taken is to leverage multi-resolution analysis using a Laplacian pyramid for each image frame of the sequence and to bandpass filter groups of pixels to identify and amplify the small changes.

- linear approach
- limitations to magnification
- noisy
