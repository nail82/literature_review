\section{Phase Based Motion Magnification}

Based on earlier work performed in the Eulerian paper, the authors of
this paper introduce a new method to amplify small motions which has
improved noise characteristics and increased amplification potential.
This work makes several modifications that qualitatively improve their
magnification results.

Replaced Laplacians with steerable pyramids using Gabor filters -
Gabors have a complex response and phase images are used to filter the
motion.  - Good experimental section. ground truthed magnification
with controlled experiments.
